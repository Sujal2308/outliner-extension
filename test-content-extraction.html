        <p>
          A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt
          to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service, or
          network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure
          with a flood of Internet traffic.
        </p>

        <p>
          DDoS attacks achieve effectiveness by utilizing multiple compromised
          computer systems as sources of attack traffic. Exploited machines can
          include computers and other networked resources such as IoT devices.
        </p>

        <h2>How DDoS Attacks Work</h2>

        <p>
          From a high level, a DDoS attack is like an unexpected traffic jam
          clogging up the highway, preventing regular traffic from arriving at
          its destination. The attack traffic consists of seemingly legitimate
          requests, making it difficult to separate the attack traffic from
          normal traffic.
        </p>

        <p>
          DDoS attacks are carried out with networks of Internet-connected
          machines. These networks consist of computers and other devices (such
          as IoT devices) which have been infected with malware, allowing them
          to be controlled remotely by an attacker. These individual devices are
          called bots (or zombies), and a group of bots is called a botnet.
        </p>

        <h2>Types of DDoS Attacks</h2>

        <p>
          DDoS attacks can be broadly categorized based on the components of
          network connection they target. The three main categories are:
        </p>

        <h3>Volume-Based Attacks</h3>
        <p>
          Volume-based attacks include UDP floods, ICMP floods, and other
          spoofed-packet floods. The attack's goal is to saturate the bandwidth
          of the attacked site, and magnitude is measured in bits per second
          (Bps).
        </p>

        <h3>Protocol Attacks</h3>
        <p>
          Protocol attacks include SYN floods, fragmented packet attacks, Ping
          of Death, Smurf DDoS and more. This category of attacks consumes
          actual server resources, or those of intermediate communication
          equipment, such as firewalls and load balancers, and is measured in
          packets per second (Pps).
        </p>

        <h3>Application Layer Attacks</h3>
        <p>
          Application layer attacks include low-and-slow attacks, GET/POST
          floods, attacks that target Apache, Windows or OpenBSD vulnerabilities
          and more. Comprised of seemingly legitimate and innocent requests, the
          goal of these attacks is to crash the web server and is measured in
          Requests per second (Rps).
        </p>

        <h2>DDoS Mitigation Strategies</h2>

        <p>
          Effective DDoS mitigation requires a comprehensive approach that
          includes proper network architecture, traffic analysis, and response
          protocols. Modern mitigation techniques involve distributed networks
          that can absorb and filter malicious traffic before it reaches the
          target.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cloud-based DDoS protection services have become increasingly
          important as they can provide the scale and sophistication needed to
          defend against large-scale attacks. These services typically use
          machine learning algorithms to distinguish between legitimate and
          malicious traffic patterns.
        </p>

        <h2>Prevention and Best Practices</h2>

        <p>
          Organizations should implement multiple layers of protection including
          firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and traffic monitoring tools.
          Regular security assessments and incident response planning are
          essential components of a robust DDoS defense strategy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Understanding the evolving landscape of DDoS attacks helps
          organizations better prepare their defenses and respond effectively
          when attacks occur. As attackers develop new techniques, defensive
          measures must also continue to evolve.
