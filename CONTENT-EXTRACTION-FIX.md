# Content Extraction Fix - "Insufficient Content Found" Error

## Problem

The extension was showing "Insufficient content found on page" errors even when pages had sufficient content. This was due to overly aggressive filtering in the content extraction logic.

## Root Cause

The content filtering was too strict with multiple restrictive thresholds:

1. **Line length requirements**: Required 20+ chars for sentences, 30+ chars for headings
2. **Final filtering**: Required 30+ chars AND 5+ words per line
3. **Content extraction thresholds**: Required 200+ chars for initial extraction, 500+ chars for fallback
4. **Short fragment filter**: Removed any line with 1-15 characters

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Reduced Line Length Requirements

- **Sentences**: Reduced from 20 chars to 15 chars
- **Headings**: Reduced from 30 chars to 25 chars
- **Added medium-length support**: Accept 10+ char lines with 3+ words

### 2. Relaxed Final Filtering

- **Minimum length**: Reduced from 30 chars to 20 chars
- **Word count**: Reduced from 5 words to 3 words

### 3. Lowered Extraction Thresholds

- **Initial extraction**: Reduced from 200 chars to 100 chars
- **Smart body extraction**: Reduced from 500 chars to 300 chars
- **Paragraph analysis fallback**: Reduced from 200 chars to 150 chars
- **Paragraph filtering**: Reduced from 50 chars to 30 chars

### 4. Adjusted Short Fragment Filter

- **Very short lines**: Reduced from 15 chars to 8 chars (keeping only truly minimal fragments out)

### 5. Added Debug Logging

- Content length tracking at each filtering stage
- Line count before and after filtering
- Final content preview for debugging

## Expected Results

### Before Fix

- Pages with good content often returned "Insufficient content found"
- Over-filtering removed meaningful short sentences and headings
- Conservative thresholds excluded legitimate content

### After Fix

- More balanced filtering that preserves meaningful content
- Retains important short sentences and headings
- Still filters out unwanted boilerplate/footer content
- Better extraction success rate on real-world pages

## Testing Instructions

1. **Load the extension** in Chrome with the updated `content.js`
2. **Test on various pages**:
   - Blog articles
   - News websites
   - Technical documentation
   - Product pages
3. **Check that**:
   - Meaningful content is extracted (not "insufficient content" error)
   - Boilerplate/footer content is still filtered out
   - Short but important sentences are preserved
   - Headings and subheadings are included

## Validation Pages

- `test-extraction-comprehensive.html` - Mixed content test
- `test-filtering-debug.html` - Simple article test
- Real websites with moderate content length

The fixes maintain the boilerplate filtering while significantly reducing false positives that were preventing legitimate content extraction.
