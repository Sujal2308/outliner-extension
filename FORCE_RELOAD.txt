         FORCE CHROME TO RELOAD THE EXTENSION 


The HTML file is CORRECT but Chrome cached the old broken version!

FOLLOW THESE STEPS EXACTLY:

1. Go to: chrome://extensions/

2. Find "Outliner AI - Webpage Summarizer"

3. Click "REMOVE" button (trash icon) - YES, REMOVE IT!

4. Click "Load unpacked" button

5. Navigate to: D:\Outliner AI\chrome-extension-package

6. Click "Select Folder"

7. Extension is now freshly loaded!

8. Click the extension icon

 YOU SHOULD NOW SEE:
- Purple/blue gradient header
- "Outliner AI" title  
- Three clean mode buttons
- NO CSS TEXT!



IF IT STILL DOESN'T WORK:

1. Close Chrome COMPLETELY (all windows)
2. Reopen Chrome
3. Go to chrome://extensions/
4. Load the extension again from: 
   D:\Outliner AI\chrome-extension-package
