## ‚úÖ MAJOR UPDATE: Improved Summarization Engine

The summarization engine has been completely rewritten to address quality and coherence issues:

### Key Improvements:

- **Logical Flow**: Summaries now maintain narrative coherence and logical connections
- **Better Sentence Selection**: Improved algorithms that consider context and importance
- **Quality Filtering**: Enhanced filters to remove navigation text, ads, and irrelevant content
- **Coherent Transitions**: Sentences are selected to work well together
- **Position-Aware Scoring**: Values introduction and conclusion sentences appropriately

### What's Fixed:

- ‚ùå **Before**: Random, disconnected sentences that didn't make sense together
- ‚úÖ **Now**: Coherent summaries that read naturally and preserve meaning
- ‚ùå **Before**: Overly complex formatting that obscured the content
- ‚úÖ **Now**: Clean, readable output focused on content quality
- ‚ùå **Before**: Poor handling of different content types
- ‚úÖ **Now**: Robust processing of articles, blog posts, and various web content

### Test Files Available:

- `test-page.html` - Basic test content
- `test-comprehensive.html` - Complex article about AI in healthcare (NEW)
- `storage-test.html` - Storage functionality testing

## ‚úÖ FIXED: Content Length Error

**Issue Fixed**: "Content is too long (max 10,000 words)" error

### Changes Made:

- **Increased word limit** from 10,000 to 25,000 words
- **Intelligent content truncation** for extremely long content (>25k words)
- **Smart processing** for very long content (>20k words)
- **Better error messages** and user feedback
- **Truncation notifications** when content is processed

### How It Works Now:

- **0-20k words**: Processed normally
- **20k-25k words**: Full processing with "large document" notification
- **25k+ words**: Intelligent truncation (first 15k + last 5k words) with notification
- **Extremely long**: Graceful handling instead of hard errors

### Test Files:

- `test-large-content.html` - Large document (~3000+ words) for testing
- `test-comprehensive.html` - Medium document for testing
- `test-page.html` - Basic document for testing
