🔧 RELOAD YOUR EXTENSION NOW!

The CSS issue is fixed! Here's what to do:

1. Go to: chrome://extensions/
2. Find "Outliner AI - Webpage Summarizer"
3. Click the RELOAD button (🔄 circular arrow icon)
4. Click the extension icon in your toolbar

The beautiful UI should now appear properly! 🎨

The issue was that popup.html was trying to load "popup-functional.js" 
but the file is actually named "popup.js". This is now fixed.

✅ What you should see now:
- Purple/blue gradient header
- "Outliner AI" title
- Three mode buttons (Brief, Detailed, Bullets)
- "Summarize Page" button
- Beautiful modern design

If you still see CSS text, press Ctrl+Shift+R to hard refresh!
